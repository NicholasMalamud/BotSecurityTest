# Bot-Security-Test

View Here: https://nicholasmalamud.github.io/BotSecurityTest.html

Cybersecurity Project, where we created a Bot that can mimic human behaviour and play a color clicking game by itself, and analyzed if we could detect whether a human or a bot was playing the game
 
 - Bot programmed in python
 - uses pyautogui to control mouse and keyboard
 - uses openCV functions to apply color filtering on the screen and identify the colored button (much faster than looking through every pixel)
 - tested on a unity game that we made, colored squares are randomly generated
